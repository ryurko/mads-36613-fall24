## Why do we visualize data?

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(datasauRus)
library(tidyverse)
datasaurus_dozen |>
  filter(dataset %in% unique(datasaurus_dozen$dataset)[1:9]) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y))+
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        strip.text = element_blank()) +
  facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 3) 
```

### **Always visualize your data** before analyzing it!

## IMPORTANT! HW0 and GenAI module in HW1

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

As seen in today's Canvas announcement - **you must submit HW0 by Thursday night!**

  + This is just to make sure you have everything installed correctly and can render `.qmd` files to PDF
  
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

HW1 is posted already, since you will complete a **Generative AI Learning Module Assignment**

All you need to do is follow the steps in the __Fostering GenAI Literacy Canvas Module: Student Information__ by completing the tasks __in order before their respective deadlines in order to receive full credit__:

1. **Knowledge Check**: Opens on Tuesday August 27 at 12:00 AM and is **due Wednesday August 28 by 11:59 PM.** This must be completed in one sitting (open for 2 hours in total, but should only take 10-20 minutes). 

2. **Learning Modules**: Opens on Thursday August 29 at 12:00 AM and is **due Friday August 30 by 11:59 PM.** This can be completed over multiple sessions.

3. **Knowledge Review**: Opens on Saturday August 31 at 12:00 AM and is **due Sunday September 1 by 11:59 PM.** This must be completed in one sitting (open for 2 hours in total, but should only take 10-20 minutes).

## Course Objectives
 
**Practice the Fundamentals of Tidy Data Wrangling and Reproducible Workflows.**

- Practice tidy data manipulation in `R` using the `tidyverse` with consistent code style

**Create High-Quality Data Visualizations and Infographics.**

- Master the use of `R` and `ggplot2` to create data visualizations and infographics that are
easily readable and understandable for technical and non-technical audiences

**Critique and Write About Data Visualizations and Infographics.**

- Give useful critiques, feedback, and suggestions for improvement on othersâ€™ graphics

## What do I mean by `tidy` data?

Data are often stored in __tabular__ (or matrix) form:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins |> slice(1:5)
```

## [The Grammar of Graphics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Originally defined by Leland Wilkinson

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

1. __data__

2. __geometries__: type of geometric objects to represent data, e.g., points, lines

3. __aesthetics__: visual characteristics of geometric objects to represent data, e.g., position, size

4. __scales__: how each aesthetic is converted into values on the graph, e.g., color scales

5. __stats__: statistical transformations to  summarize data, e.g., counts, means, regression lines

6. __facets__: split data and view as multiple graphs

7. __coordinate system__: 2D space the data are projected onto, e.g., Cartesian coordinates

[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) [created](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf) [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}

1. `data`

2. `geom`

3. `aes`: mappings of columns to geometric objects

4. `scale`: one scale for each `aes` variable

5. `stat`

6. `facet`

7. `coord`

8. `labs`: labels/guides for each variable and other parts of the plot, e.g., title, subtitle, caption

9. `theme`: customization of plot layout

## Start with the `data`

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Access `ggplot2` from the `tidyverse`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = penguins)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Or equivalently using `|>`:

```{r}
#| label: init-plot
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
penguins |>
  ggplot()
```

:::

::::

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: init-plot
```

---

## Need to add geometric objects!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}


```{r}
#| label: geom-plot
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2-4"
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point()
```

:::

::: {.column width="55%"}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"
penguins %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                       y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

:::

::::

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| label: geom-plot
```


---

## Modify scale, add statistical summary, and so on...

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "5,7,9,11,12,13,15,17,18"
#| output-location: slide
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
             y = bill_depth_mm)) + 
  # Adjust alpha of points
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  # Add smooth regression line
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  # Flip the x-axis scale
  scale_x_reverse() + 
  # Change title & axes labels 
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", 
       y = "Bill depth (mm)", 
       title = "Clustering of penguins bills") + 
  # Change the theme:
  theme_bw() +
  # Update font size of text:
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16))
  
```

## [Edward Tufte's](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) Principles of Data Visualization

***Graphics***: visually display measured quantities by combining points, lines, coordinate systems, numbers, symbols, words, shading, color

***Often our goal is to show data and/or communicate a story***

. . .

+ Induce viewer to think about substance, __not graphical methodology__

+ Make large, complex datasets more coherent 

+ Encourage comparison of different pieces of data

+ __Describe, explore, and identify relationships__

+ __Avoid data distortion and data decoration__

+ Use consistent graph design

. . .

***Avoid graphs that lead to misleading conclusions!***
