I know this is getting back to elementary school stuff, but in short, a polygon is a shape consisting of a finite number of edges to form an enclosed space. Geographic borders making up regions like countries, states, counties, etc., can be envisioned as very complex polygons.\n\n##  Plotting spatial objects with `geom_polygon()`\n  \nIn `ggplot()`, polygons are just another geometry, making it really easy to add geographic shapes (e.g. corresponding to countries, states, counties, etc.) to maps. The following code makes a county-level map of the US by utilizing the `geom_polygon()` function. This function just needs a set of latitude and longitude coordinates and the `group` that each of these coordinates belongs to. Each `group` corresponds to a polygon, and the individual latitude and longitude coordinates (many of which will belong to the same `group`) can be \"connected together\" to make a polygon. For example, for the state of Michigan, there are two groups, because it consists of two different polygons. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nus_data <- map_data(\"state\")\ncounty_data <- map_data(\"county\")\n\n#For reference, this is what us_data looks like:\nhead(us_data)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      <NA>\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      <NA>\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      <NA>\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      <NA>\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      <NA>\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      <NA>\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nus_county_map <- ggplot() + \n  #this creates all of the counties\n  geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group = group), fill = \"darkblue\", size = 4, \n               data = county_data) + \n  #this draws outlines for the states\n  geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group = group), color = 'white', \n               fill = NA, data = us_data) + \n  theme_bw() + theme(axis.text = element_blank(), \n                     axis.title = element_blank())\nus_county_map\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](09-areal-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn what follows, we'll demonstrate how you can plot state-specific data (i.e., areal data, where each subject is a state). The workflow generalizes to other regions (e.g., maybe you want to plot country-specific data, county-specific data, etc.)\n\nThe workflow will be as follows:\n\n+ Get state boundaries (i.e., the latitude and longitude information at the state level).\n\n+ Get state-specific data. For example, we will use the `state.x77` dataset in the  `datasets` package, which contains information about each of the 50 United States in the 1970s. (Despite its name, none of the data is from 1977. See `help(state.x77)` for more details.)\n\n+ Match the data from the the second bulletpoint to the data from the first bulletpoint (i.e., connect the state-specific data with the state boundary data).\n\n+ Plot the data.\n\nFirst, let's get the state boundaries. (We actually did this earlier when making our US map above, but we'll do it again here for demonstration.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#  Get state borders from ggmap package and maps\nlibrary(maps)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'maps' was built under R version 4.2.3\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'maps'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    map\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#?map_data \nstate_borders <- map_data(\"state\") \nhead(state_borders)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      <NA>\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      <NA>\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      <NA>\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      <NA>\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      <NA>\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      <NA>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we'll load the state-specific dataset, `state.x77`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(datasets)\n#Note that the state.x77 dataset looks like this:\nhead(state.x77)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n           Population Income Illiteracy Life Exp Murder HS Grad Frost   Area\nAlabama          3615   3624        2.1    69.05   15.1    41.3    20  50708\nAlaska            365   6315        1.5    69.31   11.3    66.7   152 566432\nArizona          2212   4530        1.8    70.55    7.8    58.1    15 113417\nArkansas         2110   3378        1.9    70.66   10.1    39.9    65  51945\nCalifornia      21198   5114        1.1    71.71   10.3    62.6    20 156361\nColorado         2541   4884        0.7    72.06    6.8    63.9   166 103766\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe'll need to do a minor amount of data manipulation to match the `state.x77` dataset to the `state_borders` dataset. First, note that `state.x77` technically doesn't have a column with the state names; instead, its `rownames` correspond to the state names. So, first we'll have to create a column with the state names. Second, the names within `state_borders` are all lowercase (see above), so we'll need to take that into account with matching the two datasets as well.\n\nThe following code first grabs the rownames of the `state.x77` table, then converts `state.x77` to a `tibble` named `state_data`, and then adds that column with the state names and makes them lower case:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstate_names <- rownames(state.x77)\nstate_data <- as_tibble(state.x77)\nstate_data <- state_data |>\n  mutate(state = state_names) |>\n  mutate(state = tolower(state))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can match our two datasets using `left_join()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#  join state_data data to state_borders\nstate_borders <- state_borders |>\n  left_join(state_data, by = c(\"region\" = \"state\"))\n#Note that we now have the information from state_data inside\n#our state_borders dataset:\nhead(state_borders)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       long      lat group order  region subregion Population Income Illiteracy\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      <NA>       3615   3624        2.1\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      <NA>       3615   3624        2.1\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      <NA>       3615   3624        2.1\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      <NA>       3615   3624        2.1\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      <NA>       3615   3624        2.1\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      <NA>       3615   3624        2.1\n  Life Exp Murder HS Grad Frost  Area\n1    69.05   15.1    41.3    20 50708\n2    69.05   15.1    41.3    20 50708\n3    69.05   15.1    41.3    20 50708\n4    69.05   15.1    41.3    20 50708\n5    69.05   15.1    41.3    20 50708\n6    69.05   15.1    41.3    20 50708\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we can make a plot of the state-specific data (in this case we focus on the illteracy rate by state in 1970). To do this, we just specify a `fill` within the `geom_polygon()` function. It's also helpful to use the `scale_fill_gradient2()` function to denote what the colors should be for this `fill` (below, we set the `midpoint` within this function equal to the median of the variable we are plotting, which is common practice).\n\n**Important**: If you do this (set the `midpoint` equal to the median), remember that you are forcing half the regions in your map to have \"high value\" colors and half the regions in your map to have \"low value\" colors. Furthermore, when looking at maps like the ones below, you should always keep the scale in mind. For example, there seems to be a distinction between the southern and northern US: They tend to be different colors. Ultimately, though, this difference corresponds to a 1-2% difference in illiteracy rates; we would need to (ironically) read up on illiteracy rates to better understand if this is a scientifically meaningful difference.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#  Make the plot!  \n# Before running the following code, you need to have the `mapproj` package\n# install.packages(\"mapproj\")\n#  (Change the fill variable below as you see fit)\n#  (Change the color gradient as you see fit)\nggplot(state_borders) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,\n                   fill = Illiteracy), color = \"black\") + \n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"darkgreen\", mid = \"lightgrey\", \n                       high = \"darkorchid4\", midpoint = 0.95) +\n  theme_void() +\n  coord_map(\"polyconic\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Spatial Distribution of Illiteracy Percent by State\",\n    subtitle = \"Percent of Population in State\",\n    caption = \"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census (1977)\",\n    fill = \"Illiteracy %\"\n  ) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](09-areal-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Use `coord_map()` to specify your map projection\n\nIn the above code, note that we have the line `coord_map(\"polyconic\")`. This specifies a certain kind of map projection for our plot. We can consider other projections. For example, an old-school projection we discussed in lecture was the Mercator projection. The below map is the same map as above, but with the Mercator projection.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(state_borders) + \n  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,\n                   fill = Illiteracy), color = \"black\") + \n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"darkgreen\", mid = \"lightgrey\", \n                       high = \"darkorchid4\", midpoint = 0.95) +\n  theme_void() +\n  coord_map(\"mercator\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Spatial Distribution of Illiteracy Percent by State\",\n    subtitle = \"Percent of Population in State\",\n    caption = \"U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census (1977)\",\n    fill = \"Illiteracy %\"\n  ) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](09-areal-data_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the `coord_map()` function is specifying the coordinates of our map.\n\nUnfortunately, some popular projections (like the Robinson projection and the Winkel Tripel projection) are not readily available. It's a little bit annoying to get these projections working in `R`, but it can be done: See [this tutorial](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/Winkel_tripel.html). There isn't one \"right\" projection, but some are better than others.\n\n# Statistical Analyses for Areal Data\n\nIn the illiteracy map above, it seems like there is a higher illiteracy rate in the southern US than in the northern US, but is this difference significant? \n\n## Visual Randomization Tests\n\nIn the above graph, we want to assess if illiteracy rates tend to depend on geography. So, consider the null hypothesis that illiteracy rates *do not* depend on geography. If the null hypothesis is true, what are the chances that our map just \"happened\" to look like the map above?\n\nTo answer this question, we will use a **visual randomization test**. The workflow for a visual randomization test is as follows:\n\n+ Make an areal graph of outcomes (as we did above for illiteracy rates).\n\n+ Shuffle the outcomes randomly a few times (e.g., 8 times). Make a new areal graph for each of these shuffles. (In short, you're taking the colors of your original graph and just shuffling them around the different geographic regions on the map.)\n\n+ Plot your original map along with all of the \"shuffled\" graphs, and show your graphs to someone else. Tell them that one graph is the \"real graph\" and the rest are \"random graphs.\" Can they tell which graph is the real graph? If so, then the graph we have is \"significantly non-random\" in terms of geography.\n\nBelow is the code to implement this workflow for the illiteracy example. We already completed the first bulletpoint, so now we just need to do the last two bulletpoints (below).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# It'll be helpful to write a function that automatically makes a ggplot for us.\n# This is literally the same code we used to generate the original areal map above, but for any dataset called \"state_data\".\nget_state_map_illit <- function(state_data){\n  plot <- ggplot(state_data) + \n    geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,\n                     fill = Illiteracy), color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"darkgreen\", mid = \"lightgrey\", \n                         high = \"darkorchid4\", midpoint = 0.95) +\n    theme_void() +\n    coord_map(\"polyconic\")\n  return(plot)\n}\n\n# Now we're going to permute (i.e., \"shuffle\") the outcomes a few times. \n# number of randomizations/permutations/shuffles:\nn_shuffles <- 9\n\n# It's helpful to store ggplot objects in lists in R.\n# We haven't talked much about lists in this class, but they\n# are quite flexible and easy to use.\n# For example, we're going to create an object called plot_list.\n# plot_list[[1]] refers to the first object in the list,\n# plot_list[[2]] refers to the second object in the list,\n# and so on.\nplot_list <- list(length = n_shuffles)\n# Will use a for loop to do this\nfor(i in 1:n_shuffles){\n  #create a \"randomized\" dataset\n  state_borders_rand <- state_borders\n  #shuffle the outcomes\n  state_borders_rand$Illiteracy <- sample(state_borders_rand$Illiteracy)\n  #create the plot and store it\n  plot_list[[i]] = get_state_map_illit(state_borders_rand)\n}\n# Could have also do the following for those that don't like for loops...
